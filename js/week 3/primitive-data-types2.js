    JavaScript - Primitive Data Types

    The following exercise contains the following subjects:
        * String
        * undefined

    Instructions:
        * String Tasks:
            1) Write the phrase "Welcome to Full-Stack Bootcamp" as a String in 5 different ways.

            // #1
            let one = "Welcome to Full-Stack Bootcamp";

            // #2
            let two_1 = "Welcome to";
            let two_2 = two_1 + "Full-Stack Bootcamp";
            
            // #3
            let one = "Welcome to";
            let two = "Full-Stack Bootcamp";
            let tree = one + two;

            // #4
            const x = "Full-Stack";
            let four = `Welcome to ${x} Bootcamp`;

            // #5
            const x = "Full-Stack Bootcamp";
            let four = `Welcome to ${x} `;

            2) Get the first letter of the word "Bootcamp" using two different ways.

            #1
            let x = "Bootcamp";
            x = x.charAt(0);

            #2
            let x = "Bootcamp";
            x = x[0];


            3) Write two string variables with the same word, in a way that when compared will result in false.

            const a = "hello"
            let b = "hello" 

            4) Get the length of the String from the first task.


            var str = "Welcome to Full-Stack Bootcamp";
            var n = str.length;

            5) Combine these two Strings "Hello" and "World" using as many different ways you can (at least 3).

            

        * undefined Tasks:
            1) Create an undefined variable in two differnet ways.
            2) Check if a variable is undefined in two differnet ways.
